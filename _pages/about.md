Hi, I'm Bruno. I'm a 26 years old Brazilian dude. I'm a former Officer from the Brazilian Air Force. I've worked with Software Engineering for the last 2 years and then I decided to quit the military to pursue new challenges on the market. When I'm not coding , I'm probably at the gym, reading some philosophical book , playing video games or just staying with my family.
