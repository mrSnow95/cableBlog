I decided to start this blog just to write random computer stuff, and to train my writing skills :) 

I'm 25 years old.I was born in Manaus, Brazil, where I lived until I was 15 years old, when I moved to Minas Gerais to start a prep military High School, managed by the Air Force. There I developed a strong interest for numbers, so much that during high school I was awarded two golden and one silver medals on the national physics brazilian olympiad. At the time I was the president of a scientific club where we studied for several competitions and we won many, as said [here](https://www.fab.mil.br/noticias/imprime/17403/). Following my passion on numbers, I was accepted at the [Aeronautical Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnológico_de_Aeronáutica). During my 5 year Computer Engineering course I participated in several competitive programming contests, from which i developed strong interests in Calculus and algorithms/data structures, which are my biggest passions. I travelled a lot as well, making solo backpacks in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina to develop my spanish habilities. After graduation I worked one year as an Engineer Officer of the Brazilian Air force, and after one year serving my country i finally decided to move along with my family to Portugal (thanks to my Portuguese step father), a country that i loved from the very first sight. Now I'm looking for new challenges in Portugue lands :)
