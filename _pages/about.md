I'm a former Officer from the Brazilian Air Force. I've worked with Software Engineering for the last 2 years and then I decided to quit the military and move to Portugal with my family. I'm legally living in Braga. When I'm not coding , I'm probably at the gym, reading or just staying with my family.
