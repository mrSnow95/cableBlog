A simple Search Engine its a pretty simple thing to do. Here is an example indexer using Python.

The first thing we need to do is have a way to take our documents we want to search on and turn them into an concordance. A concordance for those not in the know is a count of every word that occurs in a document.

```python 

def concordance(document):
  if type(document) != str:
    raise ValueError('Supplied Argument should be of type string')
  con = {}
  for word in document.split(' '):
    if con.has_key(word):
      con[word] = con[word] + 1
    else:
      con[word] = 1
  return con

```

The above method simply allows us to pass in a clean text document and get back a concordance of the words in that document.

The only other thing we need is a vector space. A vector space for those not in the know is a way of calculating the distances between two points. Essentially it works the same way calculating the 3rd side of a triangle. Except that instead of 2 planes (x and y) or even 3 planes (x,y,z) you can have as many planes as you want. 

```python

class VectorCompare:
  def magnitude(self,concordance):
    if type(concordance) != dict:
      raise ValueError('Supplied Argument should be of type dict')
    total = 0
    for word,count in concordance.iteritems():
      total += count ** 2
    return math.sqrt(total)

  def relation(self,concordance1, concordance2):
    if type(concordance1) != dict:
      raise ValueError('Supplied Argument 1 should be of type dict')
    if type(concordance2) != dict:
      raise ValueError('Supplied Argument 2 should be of type dict')
    relevance = 0
    topvalue = 0
    for word, count in concordance1.iteritems():
      if concordance2.has_key(word):
        topvalue += count * concordance2[word]
    if (self.magnitude(concordance1) * self.magnitude(concordance2)) != 0:
      return topvalue / (self.magnitude(concordance1) * self.magnitude(concordance2))
    else:
      return 0

  def concordance(self,document):
    if type(document) != str:
      raise ValueError('Supplied Argument should be of type string')
    con = {}
    for word in document.split(' '):
      if con.has_key(word):
        con[word] = con[word] + 1
      else:
        con[word] = 1
    return con

```

To use it you just supply two concordances (one the document and the other the query) and it returns a number from 0 to 1 of how related they are. The higher the number the more relevant the search terms are to the document.

So now all we need do, is take every document, build a concordance for it, then compare each one to our search terms, sort the results by the number returned and we are set. The documents I decided to use are the titles and first paragraph of the last 7 blogs I have posted here.


```python

v = VectorCompare()

documents = {

}

index = {
0:v.concordance(documents[0].lower()),
1:v.concordance(documents[1].lower()),
2:v.concordance(documents[2].lower()),
3:v.concordance(documents[3].lower()),
4:v.concordance(documents[4].lower()),
5:v.concordance(documents[5].lower()),
6:v.concordance(documents[6].lower()),
}

searchterm = raw_input('Enter Search Term: ')
matches = []

for i in range(len(index)):
  relation = v.relation(v.concordance(searchterm.lower()),index[i])
  if relation != 0:
    matches.append((relation,documents[i][:100]))

matches.sort(reverse=True)

for i in matches:
  print i[0],i[1]

```

Now running with some examples:

```

```

 Now there are some problems with this technique. Firstly it doesn’t support boolean searches which can be an issue, although most people tend to just type some terms. Secondly it has problems with larger documents. The way the vector space works is biased towards smaller documents since they are closer to the search term space. You can get around this by breaking larger documents up into smaller ones though. The final and biggest issue though is that it is pretty CPU intensive. I have tested a search like this with 50,000 documents and it was OK but you wouldn’t want to go much further then that. It is a pretty naive implementation though. With some caching and checking which documents are worth comparing you could take this up to millions of documents.

And its pretty easy to index 10,000 to 100,000,000 pages, but it gets considerably more difficult to index 1,000,000,000+ pages. You have to shard out to multiple computers and the margin for error is pretty low.
